Prompt: Produce a list of all monsters that spawn in "Hyrule Field", 
but with all strings in the 'drops' property replaced by the corresponding object from 'materials'.

Ideas:

different variable names, poorly named, multiple conditionals used like switch Case
utilizing strings as arrays, poorly constructed iterations, json.string used redundantly
have near all varibles global instead of called/created when needed, go against the DRY principal/rule, hard code in data where applicable
